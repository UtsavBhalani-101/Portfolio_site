          I am Utsav Bhalani, a Data Scientist, Developer and ML engineer. My approach combines technical skills with analytical thinking to solve meaningful and impactful problems.

        <p>
         My work focuses on building practical solutions rather than surface-level applications. I believe technology should serve a deeper purpose - helping us understand underlying patterns and make better decisions based on evidence.
